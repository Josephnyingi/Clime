REM If you see 'gradle' is not recognized, you need to install Gradle or use the Gradle Wrapper.
REM To use the Gradle Wrapper, run the following if you have a gradlew file in your project:
REM .\gradlew init

REM If you don't have Gradle installed, download it from https://gradle.org/install/
REM Or use a package manager like Chocolatey: choco install gradle
